# NUTinfo
Simple program to get UPS info from NUT server https://networkupstools.org/, made with Lazarus https://www.lazarus-ide.org/ (Synapse library).

Setup first:

If can't get any info see Tab Communication, and check for ERR mesages. 
If dont know what ups name is, select LIST UPS command and check what it is.
